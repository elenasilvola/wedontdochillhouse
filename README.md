# WE DONT DO CHILL HOUSE - video gallery

This project is a video gallery displaying different live music experiences I have filmed. 
The application is implemented independently with the help of AI assistance (ChatGPT), which I used to better understand concepts and troubleshoot implementation challenges.

## Project purpose
This is a personal recreational project for practising React, JavaScript, video editing and interface design. 

## Features
- Display & play videos hosted on Cloudinary
- Genre filtering (multi-select)
- Sorting logic: from most recent to least recent

## Work in Progress

- **Responsiveness**: Layout currently breaks on smaller screen sizes. Responsive behavior is under construction.

– Some genre tags may still require editing or refinement.
- Additional layout polish and animations planned.
- City filtering planned.

## Tech stack
- React
- CSS
- Cloudinary (video hosting)
- JavaScript
- Git for version control
